  Before we can start coding, weâ€™ll need to get Node
  and npm installed on your machine.

  h5 Check that Everything Is Installed Correctly
p.
  To check that Node and npm are installed correctly,
  open your terminal and type:
p.card.bg-light
  code.card-body.text-info node -v
p followed by:
p.card.bg-light
  code.card-body.text-info npm -v
p.
 That will output the version number of each program.
 At the time of writing, my Node js version is v10.10.0
 my npm version is 6.4.1.
