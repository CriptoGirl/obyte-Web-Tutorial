h3 10. Setting up obyte js Wallet
p.
  Next, you need to create a wallet to work with your application.
  This wallet will be used to fund saving data and sending payments.
p For the purposes of this tutorial we will refer to it as
  code.text-info  js Wallet
  span . Open your terminal and run:

div.card.bg-light.card-body
  pre.text-info.
    npm i byteball bitcore-mnemonic --save

br
p Then create
  code.text-info  obyte
  span  folder in your application directory and add
  code.text-info  createWallet.js
  span  file containing following code:

div.card.bg-light.card-body
  pre.text-info.
    const { toWif, getChash160 } = require('byteball/lib/utils');
    const Mnemonic = require('bitcore-mnemonic');

    const testnet = true; // Change to "false" to generate live wallet

    const path = testnet ? "m/44'/1'/0'/0/0" : "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0";
    let mnemonic = new Mnemonic();
    while (!Mnemonic.isValid(mnemonic.toString())) {
    mnemonic = new Mnemonic();
    }
    const xPrivKey = mnemonic.toHDPrivateKey();
    const { privateKey } = xPrivKey.derive(path);
    const privKeyBuf = privateKey.bn.toBuffer({ size: 32 });
    const wif = toWif(privKeyBuf, testnet);
    const pubkey = privateKey.publicKey.toBuffer().toString('base64');
    const definition = ['sig', { pubkey }];
    const address = getChash160(definition);

    console.log(
    'Seed:', mnemonic.phrase,
    '\nPath:', path,
    '\nWIF:', wif,
    '\nPublic key:', pubkey,
    '\nAddress:', address
    );

br
p Run above script to generate your
  code.text-info  js Wallet
  span  by executing following command:

div.card.bg-light.card-body
  pre.text-info.
    node obyte/createWallet

br
p This creates your
  code.text-info  js Wallet
  span .
  strong  Make note of the js Wallet's info
  span  reported on the console.
p The generated
  code.text-info  WIF
  span  will be used in obyte js integration and
  code.text-info  address
  span  will be used for funding.  When working with testnet,
  span  you can save this in
  code.text-info  obyte/TestWalletInfo.txt
  span  file. However, when working with live wallets, make sure to
  strong.
      keep this data private
  span , as anyone with access to this data would be able to control funds in your wallet!

h5 Funding your js Wallet

  code.text-info  js Wallet
  span  by sending obytes to it's address from your
  code.text-info  GUI Wallet
  span . Make sure you send enough obytes to use for testing.  20,000 or more.

p Check that everything worked by going to the
  code.text-info  #[a( href='https://testnetexplorer.obyte.org/' target="_blank" ) Testnet DAG explorer]
  span  to view public transactions and searching using your
  code.text-info  js Wallet
  span 's address.
